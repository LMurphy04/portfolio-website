# 3D Portfolio Website

Welcome to my 3D portfolio website! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€ You can check it out here: [liammurphy.dev](https://liammurphy.dev)

## About
This is a personal project where I showcase my work and experiment with 3D web development. The site is built using **Three.js**, along with React and TypeScript, to bring my ideas to life.

## Work in Progress
This website is a **continual work in progress**. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve it, whether itâ€™s optimizing performance, adding new features, or refining the design. Expect frequent updates as I learn and experiment more!

## Feedback & Contributions
I am **by no means a Three.js expert**, so some parts of the code may not be the most efficient or best practice. If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to reach out or open an issue!

Thanks for checking out my work! ðŸš€
